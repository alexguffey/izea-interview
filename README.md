# izea-interview

Hey IZEA, thank you for inviting to complete the coding portion of the interview. This was my first attempt creating an Ember app and I loved it! It was fast, lightweight, and easy to learn. I did my best to follow best practices throughout and I would love input on where to improve for next time.

Of the requirements, I did not have the chance to implement ember-cli-mirage. I also was not completely confident in my ability to write tests.

For my styling, I took advantage of the simplicity of content and went for a cheeky, brutalist style. I wanted the user to be reminded of the unrefined nature of early internet blogs and forums, but I utilized many modern design patterns to make the experience seamless and easy.

## Instructions

* `npm install`
* `ember serve`
* Visit your app at [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200).
* Visit your tests at [http://localhost:4200/tests](http://localhost:4200/tests).
